# The metric will be subject to an eigen vectors / values decomposition.
# for a better numerical stability and readability, the eigen vectors can be scaled to have integer values when possible.
# This scale is also inversely reported on the eigen values.
# By default, we strongly suggest to activate this option.

# The metric will be subject to an eigen vectors / values decomposition and likely subject to a decomposition refinement.
# These two steps may lead to numerical errors that should be corrected.
# The clean up consists in:
# - replacing the "near zero" values (i.e. x=-1.0e-8) by zero
# - replacing any floating point by the nearest integer if their respective distance is smaller than epsilon
# - replacing any floating point by the nearest decimal if their respective distance is smaller than epsilon
# By default, we strongly suggest to activate this option. If the cleanup fails, you may disable this option.

# Each multivector component of grade k can have a dedicated precomputed product if its cardinality (max number of element of grade k) is lower than this threshold.
# Else, the product is performed recursively.
# Default is 256 (full library implementation up to dim 10. Precomputed products for vectors and bivectors in dim 15.)

# Each multivector component of grade k can have a dedicated basis accessor constant (e.g. E123 in "mv[E123]=42;") if the k-vector cardinality (max number of element of grade k) is lower than this threshold.
# Else, these accessors of grade k are not created.
# Default is 256 (full library implementation up to dim 10. Accessors for scalar, vectors, bivectors, dual-bivector, dual-scalar and pseudo-scalar in dim 15.)
